### Selected projects & publications
- **MCAAT 2.0** – Spacer ordering and phage detection in metagenomic data (paper in progress) → [GitHub](https://github.com/RNABioInfo/mcaat)
  - _MCAAT 2.0 enumerates long paths in de Bruijn graphs using beam search for phage sequence recovery_ 
  - _Region where the beam search starts is nearby the CRISPR Array cluster_
  - _We are currently using datasets from [PRJNA715601](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA715601) to verify the findings_
- **MCAAT** – Metagenomic CRISPR Array Analysis Tool (first author, microLife 2025) • [GitHub](https://github.com/RNABioInfo/mcaat) → [DOI:10.1093/femsml/uqaf016](https://doi.org/10.1093/femsml/uqaf016)
  - _MCAAT scales to billion-node de Bruijn graphs, detecting CRISPR arrays in unassembled metagenomes using cycle finding algorithms_ 
  - _The workflow includes node selection based on a node indegree and coverage, cycle detection and enumeration and local alignment_
  - _We used [crisprcasdb](https://crisprcas.i2bc.paris-saclay.fr/MainDb/StrainList) to verify the correctness of the proposed approach_
- **Master’s thesis (2020)** – Cyclic codes for error detection in DNA storage → [PDF](https://feeka.github.io/cv/assets/mt_dna_storage.pdf) • [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/346902689)
